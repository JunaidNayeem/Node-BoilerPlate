# Node.js Backend Skeleton (Boilerplate)

Welcome to the Node.js backend skeleton (Boilerplate)! This boilerplate provides a solid foundation for building scalable and maintainable backend applications using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It comes pre-configured with routes, middleware, and a server setup adhering to coding standards.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, simply run the following command in your terminal:

`npm install`

This will install the following npm packages:

- body-parser
- cookie-parser
- cors
- dotenv
- express
- mongoose
- multer
- path

## Getting Started

1. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the server by running:

`node server.js`


This command will start the Node.js server, and you should see a message indicating that the server is running.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- **`routes/`**: Contains route handlers for different endpoints.
- **`middleware/`**: Contains custom middleware functions.
- **`server.js`**: Entry point of the application where the server is configured and started.
- **`config/`**: Contains configuration files such as environment variables (`.env`).
- **`models/`**: Contains database models defined using Mongoose.

Feel free to modify the structure according to your project requirements.

## Configuration

Environment-specific configuration variables can be set in the `.env` file located in the `config/` directory. Ensure that you do not commit sensitive information to version control.
